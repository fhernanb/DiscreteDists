#' grazing dataset
#'
#' In this experiment, the density of understorey birds at
#' a series of sites in two areas either side of a stockproof fence
#' were compared. Once side had limited grazing (mainly from native
#' herbivores), and the other was heavily grazed by feral herbivores,
#' mostly horses. Bird counts were done at the sites either side of
#' the fence (the Before measurements). Then the herbivores were
#' removed, and bird counts done again (the After measurements).
#' The measurements are the total number of understorey-foraging
#' birds observed in three 20-minute surveys of two hectare quadrats.
